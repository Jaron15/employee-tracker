# Employee Tracker
For this project I used mysql, inquirer, and Node.js to create a command line application that manages a company's employee database.

# Features 
* When you start the application using node index in the command line you are presented with the main menu, giving you a list of options.

* The first few options are to view the tables in the database, for example choosing view all departments will look like the following image

* The next few roles are to add to these tables, when you choose to add a department, role, or employee, you are given a prompt to give more information on what youre passing into the tables
* Once the information is added the tables are shown with the added data

# Installation 
Once you clone the repostiory, install the required packages with npm install. Set up the database by starting up a mysql shell and running the schema and seeds files with SOURCE schema.sql and SOURCE seeds.sql.
